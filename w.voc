phrase = 15 All she knew was it had to be at least two .
phrase = 15 All she knew was that she needed him in her life .
phrase = 15 And I didn ' t like the way this was going .
phrase = 15 And right now was the only time I could get them .

phrase = 15 And she knew what she wanted , just as he did .
phrase = 15 And what time of day it is , and so on .

phrase = 15 But I wasn ' t going to , not right away .
phrase = 15 But now wasn ' t the time to get into that .
phrase = 15 But right now , I have to let it all out .
phrase = 15 But she had a life before she did what she did .
phrase = 15 But she wanted to go back , had to go back .
phrase = 15 But that ' s how her life has been , too .
phrase = 15 For a while she even thought he might be her father .

phrase = 15 In his eyes , she saw how much he wanted her .
phrase = 15 I , on the other hand , was all over them .
phrase = 15 I see something that , again , I could never do .
phrase = 15 I should have thought things through that night a little better .
phrase = 15 It couldn ' t have been here more than a day .
phrase = 15 It had been a long time , but not that long .
phrase = 15 It ' s never going to be like it was again .
phrase = 15 It ' s not like I can go back in time .
phrase = 15 It ' s not there , it can ' t be .

phrase = 15 She couldn ' t be with him , not like this .
phrase = 15 She couldn ' t be with me in all of that .
phrase = 15 She couldn ' t take that , not after last night .

phrase = 15 That ' s a very long way from what you wanted .
phrase = 15 That ' s going to have to be up to you .
phrase = 15 That ' s how they are around here , I thought .
phrase = 15 That ' s not how it ' s going to work .
phrase = 15 That ' s what he wanted all of us to see .
phrase = 15 That was as much on her as it was on me .
phrase = 15 That wasn ' t how this was going to go down .
phrase = 15 That was the only way I could get out of this .
phrase = 15 That you ' d let me out when I got better .
phrase = 15 The more you have , the longer your life will be .
phrase = 15 Then it ' s just up to you to take it .
phrase = 15 Then , on another day , she wasn ' t there .
phrase = 15 There had to be more to him than what I knew .
phrase = 15 There ' s got to be more in life than that .
phrase = 15 There ' s no way she ' d be over here .
phrase = 15 There was , I felt , still some way to go .
phrase = 15 There was no time for this , for any of this .
phrase = 15 There was no way that she could get away from them .
phrase = 15 There was no way we could get through all at once .
phrase = 15 There was something about him that he didn ' t like .
phrase = 15 They can see we have been out a good long time .
phrase = 15 They never did when it was just the two of them .
phrase = 15 They wanted to go back , but I didn ' t .
phrase = 15 This is what it always came down to , she thought .
phrase = 15 This wasn ' t how she wanted her life to be .
phrase = 15 This was so not how I wanted the night to go .
phrase = 15 We could see him but he couldn ' t see us .
phrase = 15 We didn ' t like to have to work with them .
phrase = 15 We do that , and then we let go of them .
phrase = 15 well , she would have to take what she could get .
phrase = 15 You ' ve always been better at that than I have .
phrase = 16 A few more of those and they would be out of time .
phrase = 16 All she knew was that she wanted to get out of here .
phrase = 16 And after that , I did something I always wanted to do .
phrase = 16 And if he did it once , he can do it again .
phrase = 16 And if he wasn ' t going to have to leave her .
phrase = 16 And it wasn ' t something he ' d do for long .
phrase = 16 And still he couldn ' t get her out of his head .
phrase = 16 At least , that ' s what she was going to do .
phrase = 16 At least this way , which was the only way he wanted .
phrase = 16 But right now , I really have to get out of here .
phrase = 16 But the her he wanted wasn ' t the her for him .
phrase = 16 He couldn ' t take his eyes off of them right away .
phrase = 16 He ' d had her , and he no longer wanted her .
phrase = 16 He didn ' t let her go all the way this time .
phrase = 16 He had never thought about how she had felt when he left .
phrase = 16 He just held her and that was all she needed right now .
phrase = 16 He looked at it for a long while and then he knew .
phrase = 16 He might be here , or he might be on his way .
phrase = 16 He ' s been in this with me from the get go .
phrase = 16 He thought that if he wanted to leave , he would leave .
phrase = 16 He thought that if he wanted to leave , he would leave .
phrase = 16 He thought that if he wanted to leave , he would leave .
phrase = 16 He wanted her to see him every time she looked at him .
phrase = 16 He was in this now , and there was no going back .
phrase = 16 I could have her when I wanted her , and then some .
phrase = 16 I couldn ' t get that last night out of my head .
phrase = 16 I couldn ' t let him get in my head like this .
phrase = 16 I couldn ' t see it , but I always felt it .
phrase = 16 I could see he wanted to , and I wanted him to .
phrase = 16 I ' d been like this since the day I got it .
phrase = 16 I ' d like to , but I just can ' t .

phrase = 16 I had never wanted her to see me do something like that .
phrase = 16 I had never wanted her to see me do something like that .
phrase = 16 I have to work through what ' s going on with her .

phrase = 16 I knew what he wanted , and he knew what I wanted .
phrase = 16 In a way , he didn ' t see me at all .
phrase = 16 I needed him to take me , to be one with me .
phrase = 16 In his heart , he knew it could be no other way .
phrase = 16 I only knew I had to do something to get you back .
phrase = 16 I probably will really not get out of here , he thought .
phrase = 16 I saw you , and then knew you for who you were .
phrase = 16 I should probably see him and at least see what he wanted .
phrase = 16 It didn ' t get any better than this , he thought .
phrase = 16 It had just been a little while since I last had any .
phrase = 16 It might have been over for him , but not for her .
phrase = 16 It ' s been a long day for the both of us .
phrase = 16 It ' s not that I wanted to go back in time .
phrase = 16 It was all over his body , and now all over me .
phrase = 16 It was like I was there , but I wasn ' t .
phrase = 16 It wasn ' t as if he knew her , after all .
phrase = 16 It wasn ' t much , but at least it was something .
phrase = 16 It was time for him to go , and he knew it .
phrase = 16 I ' ve always made time for him and him for me .

phrase = 16 That ' s a long time to be away from all this .
phrase = 16 That ' s something I ' ve wanted to do all day .
phrase = 16 There are some things even I can ' t get out of .
phrase = 16 There were more of them than he knew what to do with .
phrase = 16 They are who she wanted and who she couldn ' t have .
phrase = 16 They couldn ' t go back to what they had been before .
phrase = 16 They had all night , and he was going to take it .
phrase = 16 This time , he felt , there would be no holding back .
phrase = 16 This time , he wasn ' t going to let her go .
phrase = 16 This wasn ' t the way I wanted the night to go .
phrase = 16 We will go there and I will see the people there again .
phrase = 17 All she wanted was to be out of here , away from him .
phrase = 17 And it ' s still that way for me after all this time .
phrase = 17 And she was who she ' d always been and always would be .
phrase = 17 At least they knew how long it would take them to get there .
phrase = 17 He couldn ' t do it right now , there was no way .
phrase = 17 He had so much to do and so little time to do it .
phrase = 17 He , of all people , was the one she needed to see .

phrase = 17 I just wanted to get on with it , that ' s all .
phrase = 17 I never have been in my life , and I never will be .
phrase = 17 I see through his eyes , and then see through eyes not his .
phrase = 17 It felt good to let his body do what it wanted for once .
phrase = 17 It ' s better for you to have me out of your life .
phrase = 17 It ' s not right , but it is the way of things .
phrase = 17 It ' s still there , and it ' s not going away .
phrase = 17 It ' s too much and I just can ' t do it .
phrase = 17 It wasn ' t just that she didn ' t have the time .
phrase = 17 It wasn ' t who he was or who he wanted to be .
phrase = 17 It was one of the few things she could still like about him .

phrase = 17 I wanted more of her , and I was going to get it .
phrase = 17 I was going to get what I wanted , and that was it .

phrase = 17 The more she saw of him the more he looked like she felt .
phrase = 17 We could take him down right now on what we have , but .
phrase = 17 We just couldn ' t do it , even if we wanted to .
phrase = 18 All that I knew was that I had to always have him with me .
phrase = 18 And just when it seemed things could not get any better , they did .
phrase = 18 And up and up and up and up and up and up and up .
phrase = 18 But she knew that she was going to have to take off work again .
phrase = 18 But she needed him , and , in his way , he needed her .
phrase = 18 He had it in him to be a good father if he wanted to .
phrase = 18 He knew what I was after , and I knew what he was after .
phrase = 18 He looked at her then , and that ' s when she saw it .
phrase = 18 He was very good at what he did , but his heart was not .
phrase = 18 I have him back , and now he ' s going to do this .
phrase = 18 I have to get out of here and I have to do it now .
phrase = 18 In my head at least , life went as I wanted it to go .
phrase = 18 It had been a long time since she ' d thought about that day .
phrase = 18 It ' s holding me back , and it has been all this time .
phrase = 18 It ' s just that there ' s no one here and I thought .

phrase = 18 She knew too much about him , and he knew too little about her .
phrase = 18 There wasn ' t much left of him by the time I was through .
phrase = 18 They didn ' t see it then , but we can see it now .
phrase = 18 You always went to him if you were going to see him at all .
phrase = 19 And if this is what she needed , it was the least I could do .
phrase = 19 And looked at me in a way she ' d never looked at me before .
phrase = 19 But , all we can do now is work with what we ' ve got .
phrase = 19 He knew it , and I knew it , and he knew I knew it .
phrase = 19 He knew what he had to do , but he didn ' t like it .
